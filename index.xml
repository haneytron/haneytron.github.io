      <description>Sabbatical week one is complete, and I&amp;rsquo;m finally finding some time to blog about it!
I had a pretty active week. It started with hurricane preparations as Dorian burled toward Florida, however in the end we suffered a very light glancing blow.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I changed things up, so I decided on a new Twitter handle and blog domain.
This site is now hosted at davidhaney.io and called &amp;ldquo;David Haney&amp;rdquo; which in my opinion is a much better (and more descriptive and maybe even more egotistical) domain than haneycodes.</description>

      <description>In case you missed the big news in the industry this week, a GitLab employee accidentally deleted a ton of production data and took their platform down for hours.

      <description>As a developer working for a company, you probably work on a team. The interactions on these teams are sometimes pleasant, and other times hostile. What’s interesting to me is that a lot of the time, a hostile interaction could have been a pleasant one if only approached differently.</description>

      <description>If you’re working on an application built using ASP.NET MVC, you’re hopefully aware of the OutputCacheAttribute attribute which can be used to statically cache your dynamic web pages. By adding this attribute to a controller or action method, the output of the method(s) will be stored in memory.</description>

      <description>In the interest of self-improvement and sharing knowledge, I felt that I should share an update to my last post. I discovered a slightly better way to create the GetMimeMapping delegate/method via reflection that involves less casting and overhead, and is more Object Oriented in a sense.</description>

      <description>I recently had a need, in an ASP.NET MVC3 application, to read raw HTML, CSS, JS, and image files from disk and return them to the user… A sort of “pass-through” if you will.</description>

      <description>So, this post is about our beloved IDE instead of actual code.
I recently upgraded my home PC from Visual Studio 2010 and 11 Beta to Visual Studio 2012. The very first thing I noticed was that after about 10 minutes of programming my Intellisense quit working and never came back.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine commented on my last post asking about how much faster the static string.Equals method is than the instance string.Equals method. To satiate both of our curiosities, I have created this benchmarking application:</description>

      <description>As you may or may not know, static methods are usually faster than instance methods. This alone should be a good enough reason to use the static string.Equals methodin .NET, but if that doesn’t do it for you, allow me to present a simple example.</description>

      <description>As of .NET 4.0, the TPL or Task Parallel Library is king when it comes to parallelization. It allows for smooth, easy multi-threading for any application. There is a slight learning curve, however, and a major part of this is understanding how Exceptions bubble-up while using the TPL.</description>

One nice feature of the .NET compiler, which is becoming better each release, is inferred typing.</description>

      <description>I came across a need at work today to re-implement some of the Output Caching for our MVC3 application which runs under .NET 4.0. I wanted to use standard Output Caching (via the OutputCacheAttributeclass, why re-invent the well-working wheel?</description>

      <description>As of .NET 3.0, LINQ (and the often related Lambda Expressions) have been available for our use and abuse. LINQ stands for Language INtegrated Query, and is a method of modelling OO data in a more or less relational sense that is not unlike databases.</description>

In order to accurately debug or profile an external assembly or library (AKA one you’re not directly compiling), you need the associated PDB filesto accompany each of the DLLs.</description>

      <description>The topic at hand is interning. More specifically, string interning.
“What is string interning?” you ask? Good question. As you may or may not know, strings are immutable reference types. This means that they are read-only and a pointer will refer to the string’s location on the heap.</description>

      <title>What is a Virtual Method, Anyway?</title>

      <description>Something which I feel carries a lot of confusion in the .NET realm is virtual methods. During interviews, I tend to ask candidates about virtual methods: why and when they’d use one, what the purposes is, how a virtual method “works” under the hood, and how it differs from “shadowing”.</description>

A question that I like to ask while interviewing individuals is: “why would you want to use an interface?</description>

      <description>This is my first post. I hope that it doesn’t suck.
As of .NET 2.0, Microsoft introduced the concept of generics. Generics is a concept that allow you to “template” methods and types such as classes and interfaces in a (generally) type-safe way.</description>
