      <description>Background I&amp;#8217;m going to discuss an important topic that affects everybody in tech: diversity.
No, this won&amp;#8217;t be some preachy post about how diversity is great and how you should be a better human being. Rather, I&amp;#8217;m going to tell you about the things I&amp;#8217;ve experienced working on diversity &amp;#8211; particularly the interesting events of the last few days that happened internally at Stack Overflow.
It&amp;#8217;s no secret that the tech industry is not that diverse.</description>

      <title>How To Guarantee Dev Team Failure</title>

      <description>The Problem I think that most devs would agree when I state that the definition of success in the corporate world of development places less emphasis on &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; code and more emphasis on &amp;#8220;working&amp;#8221; code. Working code is code that can be released to production on or before the deadline, regardless of performance or even bugs in most cases. As a developer, you ultimately feel as if you&amp;#8217;ve failed when you toil for nights on end to meet steep deadlines and churn out crappy code.</description>
