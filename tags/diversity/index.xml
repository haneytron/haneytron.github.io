      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to discuss an important topic that affects everybody in tech: diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, this won’t be some preachy post about how diversity is great and how you should be a better human being. Rather, I’m going to tell you about the things I’ve experienced working on diversity – particularly the interesting events of the last few days that happened internally at Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that the tech industry is not that diverse. It’s mostly dominated by white males, with a few women and minorities making appearances. Those who do enter the industry as a minority often feel marginalized and excluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
