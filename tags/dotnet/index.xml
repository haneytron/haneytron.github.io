      <description>Well, once again I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen off of the blogging wagon. And once again I am now getting back on said aforementioned wagon. Let&amp;rsquo;s try and make this a more regular thing than once a year or so, shall we?
I recently built a quick little hobby site / side project with .NET Core MVC. I have a lot of experience with ASP.NET MVC but I was totally new to .NET Core MVC.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to show you how I ported an Azure Classic Cloud Service application (which cost me $16 USD a month by the way) to a .NET Core Azure Function, and now host it in Azure for $0 a month! That&amp;rsquo;s right - Azure Functions are both awesome and (usually) free!

      <title>Custom ASP.NET MVC Action Result Cache Attribute</title>

      <description>If you’re working on an application built using ASP.NET MVC, you’re hopefully aware of the OutputCacheAttribute attribute which can be used to statically cache your dynamic web pages. By adding this attribute to a controller or action method, the output of the method(s) will be stored in memory. For example, if your action method renders a view, then the view page will be cached in memory. This cached view page is then available to the application for all subsequent requests (or until the item expires out of the cache), which can retrieve it from the memory rather than redoing the work to re-create the result again.</description>

      <description>Intro Node.js – it has rapidly become the “new hotness” in the tech start-up realm. With each passing day, the fan base of Node lovers grows larger, spreading their rhetoric like a religion. How do you spot a Node.js user? Don’t worry, they’ll let you know.

      <description>It looks as if the Visual Studio dev team may be implementing a new operator in a future .NET release. This is due in large part to community demand, which is pretty cool because it shows that the VS team is listening to their customer base; a key part of a successful product.
This new operator is likely going to take the syntax of ?. and is known as the Safe Navigation Operator.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an ASP.NET MVC issue at work where the validation for my Model was not firing correctly. The Model implemented the IValidatableObject interface and thus the Validate method which did some specific logic to ensure the state of the Model (the ModelState). This Model also had some DataAnnotation attributes on it to validate basic input.
Long story short, the issue I encountered was that when ModelState.IsValid == false due to failure of the DataAnnotation validation, the IValidatableObject.</description>

      <description>MVC4 made one simple and yet awesome improvement to View rendering that I don’t think many people are aware of.
Have you ever had to conditionally add an attribute to an HTML element in your MVC View based on the presence of a variable? The typical use case is applying a CSS class to a div. Most of the time that code looks something like this:
&amp;lt;div @(myClass == null ?</description>

      <description>The T4 template engine is insanely powerful. I didn’t really realize just how powerful it was until I had a use case for it today. I stood up a database with about 40 tables in it, and planned to use an ORM to access the database. To use the ORM, I needed POCOs (Plain Old C# Objects) that represented my database. Some of these tables had 30-50 or so columns and I didn’t want to code all of this by hand – it would take literally days.</description>

      <description>If you’re using the Web API as part of the MVC4 framework, you may encounter a scenario in which you must map parameters of strange names to variables for which characters of the name would be illegal. That wasn’t very clear, so let’s do this by example. Consider part of the Facebook API:
Firstly, Facebook servers will make a single HTTP GET to your callback URL when you try to add or modify a subscription.</description>

      <description>One of the many things that I do at work is run a full-blown Search Engine which I also developed from scratch. This Search Engine feeds all product related information to our websites. A search index consists of a pre-computed collection of products, their properties, a list of words that are correctly spelled, and some pre-computed faceted/guided navigation. A search index, until this week, took up approximately 10.7 gigs of memory.</description>

      <description>In the interest of self-improvement and sharing knowledge, I felt that I should share an update to my last post. I discovered a slightly better way to create the GetMimeMapping delegate/method via reflection that involves less casting and overhead, and is more Object Oriented in a sense. It allows the signature of the reflected method to be Func&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt; instead of MethodInfo. Code below, note the use of Delegate.CreateDelegate(Type, MethodInfo):</description>

      <description>I recently had a need, in an ASP.NET MVC3 application, to read raw HTML, CSS, JS, and image files from disk and return them to the user… A sort of “pass-through” if you will. Normally I’d have simply routed to a custom HTTP handler per file type or just allowed MVC3 to map existing files to supply its own .NET HTTP handlers and do all of this work for me, but in this case I needed the mapped “directory” to switch behind the scenes based on Session settings… So I ultimately had to feed these files through a Controller and Action Method to gain access to the Session.</description>

      <description>Most of us have been there: you’ve written a fantastic application that performs perfectly in your Development and/or QA environments, but in Production something goes wrong. Your application spins out of control, utilizing 100% of your CPU. Maybe it simply stops responding as if it were deadlocked. Or maybe it simply crashes randomly. What now?
Logic tells you that you have a problem in the code somewhere that is only encountered in a Production-like environment… and if you could JUST get into the Production box, install Visual Studio (or at least the Remote Debugger), and debug the application, you’d be able to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Static vs Instance string.Equals Benchmark</title>

      <description>A friend of mine commented on my last post asking about how much faster the static string.Equals method is than the instance string.Equals method. To satiate both of our curiosities, I have created this benchmarking application:
static void Main(string[] args){var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();string a = &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;;string b = &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;;stopwatch.Start();for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000000; i++){a.Equals(b);}stopwatch.Stop();Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Instance string.Equals over 10,000,000 iterations: &amp;quot; + stopwatch.</description>

      <description>As you may or may not know, static methods are usually faster than instance methods. This alone should be a good enough reason to use the static string.Equals method in .NET, but if that doesn’t do it for you, allow me to present a simple example.
string a = &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;;string b = &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;;bool result = a.Equals(b);What is the expected result of these lines? A boolean value of false, of course.</description>

      <description>Two of my colleagues (one from work and one from a user group) kindly pointed out to me that in my last post I omitted Continuation Tasks as a means of Error Handling for the TPL. As such, I will expand upon my last post with an example of handling errors via a Continuation Task.
Continuing where we left off last, the following code will utilize a Task Continuation to handle errors within Tasks.</description>

      <description>As of .NET 4.0, the TPL or Task Parallel Library is king when it comes to parallelization. It allows for smooth, easy multi-threading for any application. There is a slight learning curve, however, and a major part of this is understanding how Exceptions bubble-up while using the TPL.
Let’s partake in a simple example. This code will create and run a task that throws an Exception, and then attempt to catch it:</description>

      <description>I came across a need at work today to re-implement some of the Output Caching for our MVC3 application which runs under .NET 4.0. I wanted to use standard Output Caching (via the OutputCacheAttribute class, why re-invent the well-working wheel?) but due to some of our requirements I needed more control over how my objects were cached. More specifically, I needed to cache them with a custom Cache Dependency. With a little bit of Google-Fu, I was delighted to learn of the Output Cache Provider functionality introduced in ASP.</description>

      <description>As of .NET 3.0, LINQ (and the often related Lambda Expressions) have been available for our use and abuse. LINQ stands for Language INtegrated Query, and is a method of modelling OO data in a more or less relational sense that is not unlike databases. And just like databases, it comes with a cost.
To offset this cost, LINQ uses Deferred Execution. Deferred Execution means that the code is not executed until it is needed.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the delay in posts, May has been a very busy month.
In order to accurately debug or profile an external assembly or library (AKA one you’re not directly compiling), you need the associated PDB files to accompany each of the DLLs. These files give the debugger some information about the compiled assembly so that your debugger or profiler can become aware of function names, line numbers, and other related meta data.</description>

      <description>The topic at hand is interning. More specifically, string interning.
“What is string interning?” you ask? Good question. As you may or may not know, strings are immutable reference types. This means that they are read-only and a pointer will refer to the string’s location on the heap. Typically, a new string is created and stored within your application’s memory each time that you assign a string – even if the same string is defined repeatedly.</description>

      <description>Something which I feel carries a lot of confusion in the .NET realm is virtual methods. During interviews, I tend to ask candidates about virtual methods: why and when they’d use one, what the purposes is, how a virtual method “works” under the hood, and how it differs from “shadowing”. Surprisingly, in what has probably been over one hundred interviews with senior-ish candidates, I don’t believe that more than one or two of them have answered anything about virtual methods correctly.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Generic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://www.davidhaney.io/an-overview-of-generic-constraints/</link>

      <guid>https://www.davidhaney.io/an-overview-of-generic-constraints/</guid>
      <description>This is my first post. I hope that it doesn’t suck.
As of .NET 2.0, Microsoft introduced the concept of generics. Generics is a concept that allow you to “template” methods and types such as classes and interfaces in a (generally) type-safe way. Upon compilation, generic type metadata is stored in IL, and JIT’d as you reference the generic method or class with an actual type at runtime. Value types each get their own “copy” of the JIT’d generic code, whereas reference types share a single instance of the code.</description>
