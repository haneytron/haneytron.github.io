      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today an article was brought to my attention. One that, at the time of writing this post, had hit the front page of various sites (including Hacker News) and had been shared over 2,600 times. The article is &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/on-secretly-terrible-engineers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;On Secretly Terrible Engineers&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;, which is a criticism of the tech industry and the mentality which it holds towards hiring both new and experienced developers/engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler:&lt;/strong&gt; I strongly disagree with most of this article. If you arenâ€™t open to debates and discussion, quit reading here and return to your normal activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
