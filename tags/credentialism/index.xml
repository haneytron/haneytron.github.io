      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re just two days from a brand new year and yet the primary measurement of a developer’s skill seems to be the same as it was 20 years ago. The most important classification to most companies is job title, as I talked about in great detail in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.davidhaney.io/the-trouble-with-job-titles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a good career so far. I began working full-time as a programmer in 2008. At that time my title was &lt;strong&gt;Junior Developer&lt;/strong&gt;. I had a decent boss and cool co-workers, and I cut my teeth on Java and .NET. It was a good experience. After 2 years at that gig, I felt that it was time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I contacted recruiters, and one eventually found me a promotion: &lt;strong&gt;Systems Analyst&lt;/strong&gt;. It came with a decent pay bump and so forth, as well as the luxury of dropping “&lt;strong&gt;Junior&lt;/strong&gt;” from my job title. As this was a good deal all around, I took the offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
