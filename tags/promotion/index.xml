      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February of 2015, I was promoted to Engineering Manager at Stack Overflow. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Chapter_1_2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are tons of things I’ve learned so far, some of which I’ve learned the hard way. There’s also a world of difference between managing code, and managing people who code. Your day to day work routine changes completely. You define success differently. You feel a little bit like you just rebooted your career and are starting over at the bottom of the skills ladder. It’s intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
