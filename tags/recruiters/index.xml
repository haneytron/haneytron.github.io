      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-job-listing&#34;&gt;A Job Listing&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you were walking down a street one day and noticed an ad for help wanted. It is posted in the window of a bakery. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HELP WANTED:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Need a baker for FT work. Must be familiar with modern baking methods such as ovens, barbecuing, and deep fryers. 5+ years experience with the Super 6 commercial baking oven required (aside: came out in 2014). Nice to haves include experience with butcher’s blocks, chopping meat, and making candles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
