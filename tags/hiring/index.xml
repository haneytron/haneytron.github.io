      <description>A few weeks back I wrote this tweet:
43 likes later, it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that this topic is in-demand. So, let&amp;rsquo;s skip over the pleasantries and talk about how you can create a great technical résumé as a junior developer, from the perspective of me (a hiring manager).
So let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in! I&amp;rsquo;m going to add photos of my junior résumé here as we go as well, to give you a nice visual of what I am talking about.</description>

      <description>Well I failed badly in my mission to blog every week of 2017. I guess life and stuff just got in the way in the end. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be more consistent in the second half of 2018.
Anyway, I bring some news: I have a new blog engine, and we are hiring at Stack Overflow!
New blog engine I was previously using WordPress but had many issues and concerns with it.</description>
