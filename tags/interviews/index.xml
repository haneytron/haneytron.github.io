      <description>A few weeks back I wrote this tweet:
43 likes later, it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that this topic is in-demand. So, let&amp;rsquo;s skip over the pleasantries and talk about how you can create a great technical résumé as a junior developer, from the perspective of me (a hiring manager).
So let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in! I&amp;rsquo;m going to add photos of my junior résumé here as we go as well, to give you a nice visual of what I am talking about.</description>

      <title>On Hiring: Developers Are Like Stocks</title>

      <description>This post is for those of you who hire developers, and also junior developers who want to be hired. Let’s talk about how developers are just like individual stocks in the stock market. Time for a little role-playing: you’re now a stock market investor.
As a financial advisor, your company has given you $2,000,000 USD to invest in the stock market. It’s made very clear that the future of the company depends on the return on investment (herein called ROI) – “gains” – that your investments bring to the company.</description>

      <title>On Credentialism In Software Development</title>

      <description>Intro We’re just two days from a brand new year and yet the primary measurement of a developer’s skill seems to be the same as it was 20 years ago. The most important classification to most companies is job title, as I talked about in great detail in my last post. The job title is acquired via working for a veritable slough of credentialist companies whose HR departments break it down very simply:</description>

      <title>The Trouble With Job Titles</title>

      <description>Intro I’ve had a good career so far. I began working full-time as a programmer in 2008. At that time my title was Junior Developer. I had a decent boss and cool co-workers, and I cut my teeth on Java and .NET. It was a good experience. After 2 years at that gig, I felt that it was time to move on.
I contacted recruiters, and one eventually found me a promotion: Systems Analyst.</description>

      <title>How I Got A Job At Stack Exchange</title>

      <description>Intro Almost exactly 1 month ago today I found myself on a video call with Joel Spolsky. It feels insane to write that, even now, as it was a banner moment in my career. For me it was the equivalent of meeting a movie star who I had idolized since I was old enough to know what movies were. There had always been this Joel Spolsky guy throughout my career that I regularly read about and whose opinions on software development agreed with mine, and suddenly I was talking with him face to face.</description>

      <title>Interview with InfoQ on SimplSockets</title>

      <description>Jonathan Allen of InfoQconducted an interview with me about one of my open source initiatives, SimplSockets. We discussed the value of TCP over HTTP and why Sockets are still relevant to programming.
I’d like to thank Jonathan and InfoQ for the opportunity – it was a great discussion. Check it out here: http://www.</description>

      <title>The Joel Test Really is Meaningful</title>

      <description>Well, it’s been nearly 2 months since my last post… I’m learning that if you want a blog to be successful, you have to carve time out of your busy life and make it happen. So, with renewed focus, I re-enter the fray.
The Joel Testis a curious and honest thing. It has been around since the year 2000 and was invented by a guy named Joel Spolsky, as the name might imply.</description>
